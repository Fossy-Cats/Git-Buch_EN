# About

This is the English translation of the German book _Git, Verteilte Versionskontrolle für Code und Dokumente_ (Git, Distributed version control for code and documents) by [Valentin Haenel] and [Julius Plenz], 2nd Ed. 2014 — aka _Das Git-Buch_.

The _Git_ book was published in paperback and eBook editions by __[Open Source Press]__ (2003–2015), a Munich based computer book publisher specialized in open-source software and philosophy topics.

- [paperback edition] — Wayback Machine, 2015.
- [digital editions] — Wayback Machine, 2015.


When __[Open Source Press]__ ceased all publishing activities in December 2015, it transferred all the rights of the published texts back to their original authors.
V.Haenel and J.Plenz decided to release their _Git_ book under Creative Commons license, and published its full sources in AsciiDoc on GitHub:

- [github.com/gitbuch/gitbuch_cc]

This repository is dedicated to the English translation of the book, based on the original German repository (commit [`76af76a`][76af76a]).

Since in the German world the book is commonly referred to as _Das Git-Buch_ (The Git Book), I've opted to name the translation project as __Git-Buch EN__ as a way to emphasize the link to original German edition and to avoid confusion with other similarly titled books already available in English.
